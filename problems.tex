\begin{enumerate}
\item Solve and describe long term behaviour of a recurrence function defined by the following equation and initial condition:
\begin{itemize}
	\item $4y_{t} - 12y_{t-1} + 1 = 0$ and $y_{0} = 1$
	\item $4y_{t} - 12y_{t-1} + 1 = 0$ and $y_{0} = 20$
	\item $7(y_{t} - y_{t-1}) = 3$ and $y_{0} = 1$
	\item $4(y_{t} + y_{t-1}) = 2$ and $y_{0} = 7$
	\item $10(y_{t} + 2y_{t-1} - 30) = 0$ and $y_{0} = 100$
\end{itemize}
\item 2007 exam, question 1(a) and look at 1(b) because that's what we're going to start with on Tuesday
\item Find present value $P$ of the following:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \$2000 received 2 years from now given bank account with annual interest compounded with rate $r = 5\%$ 
	\item \$400 received now given account with interest compounded continuously with rate $r = 0.1\%$
	\item Salary of \$4500 received annually for 5 years given bank account with interest compounded continuously at rate $r = 1.5\% $
	\item Amount $M$ received at after $n$ years given bank account with annually compounded interest with rate $r$.
	\item Amount $M$ received at after $n$ years given bank account with continuously compounded interest with rate $r$.
	\item Salary $S$ received annually for $n$ years given bank account with annually compounded interest with rate $r$.
	\item Salary $S$ received annually for $n$ years given bank account with continuously compounded interest with rate $r$.
\end{itemize}
\item Find and describe the nature of stationary points of the following functions:
\begin{itemize}
	\item $y = 3x^{4} + 8x^{3}$
	\item $y = e^{x^3/10}$
	\item $p^D(q) = \dfrac{q^4}{100} + \dfrac{q^3}{40} + 10q - 150$
	\item $P(x) = -5x^4 - 100x^2 + 12$
	\item $V(t) = 300t^3 - 14t^2$
	\item $y(t) = (t+2)^4$
	\item $y = \dfrac{x^3 + 20x^2 + 100}{(x+1)^2}$
	\item $P(t) = (t^3 + 30t)e^{t^2/4}$
\end{itemize}
\item Find and describe the nature of stationary points of functions given by the recurrence equations from question 1.
