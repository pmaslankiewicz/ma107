\section{Recurrence equations}
Equations relating values of $y$ at discrete points in time, expressing value $y_{t}$ of $y$ at time $t$ as a function of $y_{t-1}$, one unit of time before time $t$.

\subsection{Solving recurrence equations}
Solving recurrence equation refers to finding value of $y_{t}$ as a function of ${t}$.
			
\begin{problem}
Solve the recurrence equation \[y_{t} = ay_{t-1} + b\] for $t \geq 0$ given that $y_{0} = C$.
\end{problem}

\begin{solution}
After making sure that the equation you're solving is in the form \[y_{t} = ay_{t-1} + b\] you proceed as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item If $a = 1$ your solution is $y_{t} = y_{0} + bt$. Otherwise:
	\item Make sure that your recurrence equation is of the form $y_{t} = ay_{t-1} + b$ for $a, b$ constants.
	\item Find $y^{\ast} = \dfrac{b}{1-a}$ where $a, b$ are constants from the equation above.
	\item Solution is $y(t) = y^{\ast} + (y_{0} - y^{\ast})a^{t}$
\end{enumerate}
\end{solution}

\subsection{Long term behaviour}
Describing behaviour of function $y_{t}$ as $t \rightarrow \infty$.

\begin{problem}
Given $ y_{t} = ay_{t-1} + b\ $ how does $y_{t}$ behave as $t$ tends to infinity?
\end{problem}

\begin{solution}
Assume recurrence equation $y_{t} = ay_{t-1} + b$ and time independent solution $y^{\ast}$, long term behaviour of $y_{t}$ \textbf{depends on coefficient} $\mathbf{a}$:
\begin{itemize}
	\item If $\mathbf{1 < a}$, then the function \textbf{increases unboundedly}($y_{t} \rightarrow +\infty$) if $y_{0} > y^{\ast}$ and the function \textbf{decreases unboundedly} $y_{t} \rightarrow -\infty$ $y_{0} < y^{\ast}$
	\item If $\mathbf{0 < a < 1}$, then the \textbf{function increases towards $y^{\ast}$}($y_{t} \rightarrow y^{\ast}$) if $y_{0} > y^{\ast}$ and the \textbf{function decreases towards $y^{\ast}$}($y_{t} \rightarrow y^{\ast}$) if $y_{0} < y^{\ast}$
	\item If $\mathbf{-1 < a < 0}$, then $y_{t}$ \textbf{oscillates towards $y^{\ast}$}.
	\item If $\mathbf{-1 < a < 0}$, then $y_{t}$ \textbf{oscillates unboundedly}.
\end{itemize}
\end{solution}

\subsection{Investment schemes}
Comparing return from different investments in terms of their present value.

\begin{problem}
Given access to a bank account with interest rate $r$ accrued annually at the end of each year and an asset with value function $V(t)$ calculate present value of selling said asset after $t$ years.
\end{problem}

\begin{solution}
Present value $P(t)$ is given by the equation \[ P(t) = V(t)(1+r)^{-t} \]
\end{solution}

\begin{problem}
Given access to a bank account with continuously compounded interest with rate $r$ and an asset with value function $V(t)$ calculate present value of selling said asset after $t$ years.
\end{problem}

\begin{solution}
Present value $P(t)$ is given by the equation \[ P(t) = V(t)e^{-tr} \]
\end{solution}

\section{Optimisation of functions in one variable}
Identifying stationary points (minima and maxima) and economically significant values such as marginal cost, break-even point, starting point etc.

\subsection{Differentiation}
Mathematical theory allowing for economical analysis of function's behaviour.

\begin{definition}[Lagrange's definition of a derivative]
Define the derivative of a function $f(x)$ with respect to $x$ to be 
\[f'(x) = lim_{h \rightarrow \infty} \dfrac{f(x+h) - f(x)}{h}\]
\end{definition}

Standard derivatives include:
\begin{itemize}
	\item $(e^x)'=e^x$
	\item $(ln(x))'=\dfrac{1}{x}$ for $x > 0$
	\item $(sin(x))'=cos(x)$
	\item $(cos(x))'=-sin(x)$
	\item $(x^n)'=nx^{n-1}$
\end{itemize}

\begin{definition}[Product rule]
For a product of two functions $f$ and $g$ we have that:
\[(f\cdot g)'=f'\cdot g + f\cdot g'\]
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Quotient rule]
For a quotient of two functions $f$ and $g$ we have that:
\[(\dfrac{f}{g})'=\dfrac{f'\cdot g + f\cdot g'}{g \cdot g}\]
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Chain rule]
For a composition of two functions $f$ and $g$ we have that:
\[(f \circ g)' = f'(g(x))g'(x)\]
\end{definition}

\begin{problem}
Describe nature of all stationary points of a function $f(x)$.
\end{problem}

\begin{solution}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Calculate first derivative $f'(x)$ of $f$.
	\item Find all values of $x$ for which $f'(x)=0$. These are the \textbf{stationary points}.
	\item Compute value of second derivative $f''(p)$ at every previously found stationary point $p$.
	\begin{itemize}
		\item If $f''(p) > 0$ then $p$ is a (local) minimum.
		\item If $f''(p) < 0$ then $p$ is a (local) maximum.
		\item If $f''(p) = 0$ then look at the sign of a $f'(x)$ for $x$ on both sides if $p$.
		\begin{itemize}
			\item If $f'(x)$ changes sign from + to - at $p$ then we have a (local) maximum.
			\item If $f'(x)$ changes sign from - to + at $p$ then we have a (local) minimum.
			\item If sign of $f'(x)$ does not change sign at $p$ then $p$ is an inflection point (neither min nor max).
		\end{itemize}
	\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}
\end{solution}

\subsection{Cost related optimisation}

\begin{definition} [Profit function]
Define \textbf{profit} $\Pi$ of a firm as a function of produced quantity $q$ to be:
\[\Pi(q) = pq - C(q)\]
where for a \textbf{small, efficient firm} we treat $p$ as a constant since the amount it produces does not affect market price.\\\\
Define indirect profit $\Pi^\ast$ of a firm to be a profit function $\Pi$ evaluated at its stationary point $q^\ast$ ie $\Pi^\ast = pq^\ast - C(q^\ast)$. 
\end{definition}

\begin{definition} [Start-up and break-even points]

Given a supplier firm with cost and profit functions $C(q), \Pi(q)$ define:

\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{start-up point} $q_s$ to be the largest quantity $q$ produced that will bring the same profit as producing nothing. \\It can be found as a solution to:
\[\Pi(q_s) = \Pi(0)\]
	\item \textbf{break-even point} $q_b$ to be the smallest quantity $q$ produced that will cover the cost of production. \\It can be found as a solution to:
\[\Pi(q_b) = 0\]
\end{itemize} 

\end{definition}
